# Book Recommendation System
This project is a simple book recommendation system that suggests books based on the aggregated ratings of all users. The model identifies popular books that have been highly rated by the user community and recommends these titles to any user.

## Features:
Data Processing: The model processes user ratings to identify books that are widely enjoyed across the user base.
Recommendation Engine: Recommendations are generated based on the collective preferences of all users, rather than individual user profiles.
Model Deployment: The recommendation model is deployed and made accessible via an interactive interface created using Flask.
User Interface: A clean and intuitive interface built with Flask allows users to interact with the recommendation engine and view book suggestions.
## How It Works:
Model Training: The model is trained using a dataset of user ratings, where it learns to identify books that are most popular among users.
Recommendations: When a user interacts with the system, the model suggests books that have received high ratings from other users.
Flask Integration: The results are displayed on a web interface powered by Flask, allowing users to see and explore the recommendations easily.
## Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language used for model development.
Pandas & NumPy: Libraries used for data processing and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the recommendation model.
Flask: Used to create the web interface and serve the recommendation results.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
## How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the Flask app to start the server and access the recommendation system through your web browser.
